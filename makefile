This is the top level make file for ModFW.

NOTE: ModFW is not a build tool. Instead, ModFW is an integration tool. ModFW is intended to integrate a variety of build tools which are used to build both software and hardware components to be integrated into a complete system.

This make file and the included make segments define a framework for developing new projects or modifying existing projects. A project can consist of both software and hardware. All of the tools and existing components needed to build the project are automatically downloaded, configured, built, and installed when needed.

Definitions:
  context:
    The directory from which ModFW is being run defines the context in which mods are build.

  deliverable:
    A deliverable is the end result of a ModFW run. In make terminology, a deliverable is an end goal or target. In ModFW a deliverable is a file which can be:
      - A software executable or library.
      - A file describing an object which can be manufactured using a 3D printer, CNC or other means.
      - A file describing a printed circuit board needed to manufacture and assemble the board.
      - A bill of materials (BOM) for off the shelf parts.

  project:
    A project is the collection of one or more deliverables which serve a specific purpose. By default all components, intermediate files and deliverables are contained in the project directory tree. This allows different projects to use different versions of kits without worry of version conflicts. The disadvantage of this approach is the potential of having multiple copies of mods so one must be careful when editing mods to avoid mistakenly modifying a file in the wrong project. Components from multiple projects within the ModFW directory tree can be integrated into a complete system. See prj definition for more information about projects.

  seg:
    Indicates the name of a makefile segment (included file). Changing the name of the file changes the name of the associated variables, macros, and goals.

  mod:
    The collection of files for a given deliverable is termed a mod. Semantically, a mod is a modification of an existing deliverable or a mod can be the development a new deliverable. A mod can be dependent upon the goals of other mods. See help-mods for more information.

  kit:
    A kit is a collection of mods. Each kit is a separate git repository and is cloned from the remote repository when needed. New kits can be created locally. All kits used in a ModFW run must have unique names. See help-kits for more information.

  prj:
    Defines the mods comprising a project. This can be as simple as a single makefile segment but can include project documentation as well as goals for packaging the project deliverables. A project is maintained as a separate git repository. Similar to a kit, a project is automatically cloned when needed or can be created locally. The makefile segment for the project should define the kit repo URLs and branches. One project can be the "active" project. Sticky variables are stored in the active project directory. See  help-helpers for more information about sticky variables. The active project is specified using the PROJECT variable. See help-projects for more information.

  comp:
    A ModFW component. A component can be a mod, kit, or project. All ModFW components contain at minimum a makefile segment having the same name.

  node:
    A data structure which describes a ModFW related directory. Nodes are organized into a tree structure. See help-nodes for more information.

  repo:
    A node which is also a clone of a git repository.

  dev:
    The designer and/or developer of a project.

Project Structure

Projects use mods and mods use kits. To help avoid name collisions between kits projects use mod references to specify which mods to use. A mod reference has the form <kit>.<mod>. The referenced mod installs its kit if necessary. Aproject should not need to install a kit before using a mod. See help-modsfor more information.

To help identify the purpose of project and kit repos it is recommended project repo names be prefixed with mfw-prj- and kit repos be prefixed with mfw-kit-.

Repositories and branches:
  As previously mentioned projects and kits are separate git repositories. Mods can be dependent upon the output of other projects and kits. Different mods can be dependent upon different versions of projects and kits. Managing this potential web of dependencies can be a nightmare and lead to disk thrashing when switching to different branches because of mod interdependencies. Therefore, only one branch of a repository can be active. The branch can be specified at the time the repository is cloned. Thereafter, branches must be switched manually and all interdependent components can only use the same branch of a given repository.

Naming conventions:
<seg>
  The name of a segment. This is used to declare segment specific variables and to derive directory and file names. As a result no two segments can have the same file name.

<seg>.mk
  The name of a makefile segment. A makefile segment is designed to be included from another file. These should be formatted to contain a preamble and postamble. See help-helpers for more information.

GLOBAL_VARIABLE
  Can be overridden on the command line. Sticky variables should have this form unless they are for a particular context in which case the should use the <ctx>.VARIABLE form (below). See help-Sticky for more information about sticky variables.

global_variable
  Available to all segments but should not be overridden on the command line. Attempts to override can have unpredictable results.

<ctx>
  A specific context. A context can be a segment, macro or group of related variables.

<ctx>.VARIABLE
  A global variable prefixed with the name of specific context. These can be overridden on the command line. Component specific sticky variables should use this form.

<ctx>.variable
  A global variable prefixed with the name of the context defining the variable. These should not be overridden.

_private_variable
  Make segment specific. Should not be used by other segments since these can be changed without concern for other segments.

callable-macro
  The name of a callable macro available to all segments.

_private-macro
  A private macro specific to a segment.

GlobalVariable
  Camel case is used to identify variables defined by the helpers. This is mostly helpers.mk.

Global_Variable
  This form is also used by the helpers to bring more attention to a variable.

Callable-Macro
  The name of a helper defined callable macro.

WARNING: Even though make allows variable names to begin with a numericcharacter this must be avoided for all variable names which could be exported to the environment to be passed to a shell. If a numeric character is used as the first character of an exported variable name unpredictable behavior can occur. This is particularly important for PROJECT, KIT, MOD, and segment names. To help avoid this problem use the helpers provided macro To-Shell-Var to convert a name to a shell compatible name which can then safely be exported to the shell environment.

Overriding variables:
An overrides file, overrides.mk, is supported where the developer can preset variables rather than having to define them on the command line. This file is intended to be temporary and is not maintained as part of the repository (i.e. ignored in .gitignore). The overrides.mk file is loaded immediately. None of the helpers are available. Therefore overrides should only define variables which would otherwise be defined on the command line.

Additional project, kit and mod specific overrides can be declared and maintained in a project repository. Unlike overrides.mk the helpers will be available to the project overrides. See help-projects for more information.

Makefile processing:
ModFW divides makefile processing into two distinct phases; pre-process and execute.

During the pre-process phase nearly all macros are executed and makefile segments are loaded. Any repos that are referenced are cloned or setup during this phase. Because of this, variables should be declared using the := form. New components (project, kit, or mod) are created during this phase.

The execute phase is where the typical make behavior occurs. Dependencies are examined and resolved in this phase.

Architectural components:
Workstation
  A development workstation or a system administration workstation.
Proxy
  Manages connections between workstations and gateways. This is typically hosted in the cloud.
Gateway
  Serves as a protocol translator between the Controller and the workstation.
Controller
  Controls the device hardware.

Hardware platforms:
PC  = A personal computer.
SBC = A single board computer.
MCU = An embedded microcontroller.
HDW = The device or machine being controlled. For example a 3D printer.

Hardware roles:
WS  = Development or administration workstation.
UI  = User interface either command line or graphical or both.
PRX = The proxy hosted in the cloud.
GW  = Gateway (protocol translation) between the CTL and the system.
CTL = The device controller.

ModFW directly supports the following design patterns. If necessary mods can either change the patterns or define new ones.

Design patterns:

  Direct:
  MCU_ACCESS_METHOD = direct
  Direct interface to the MCU from a PC workstation. In this case there is no gateway and no OS image is staged.
  +-PC----------+   +-MCU--------+   +-HDW------+
  | Workstation |<->| Controller |<->| Hardware |
  +-WS----------+ ^ +-CTL--------+ ^ +----------+
    GW            |                |
    UI            MCU defined      Hardware system bus
                  (typically a
                  serial port)

  Console:
  MCU_ACCESS_METHOD = standalone
  Similar to direct but the SBC is the user interface and a corresponding OS image for the SBC is staged. In this case there is no network interface.
  Software updates in this case must be performed manually at the Gateway.
  +-SBC-----+   +-MCU--------+   +-HDW------+
  | Gateway |<->| Controller |<->| Hardware |
  +-GW------+ ^ +-CTL--------+ ^ +----------+
    UI        |                |
              MCU defined      Hardware system bus
              (typically a
              serial port)

  Local network:
  MCU_ACCESS_METHOD = headless
  SSH sessions are used to communicate with the Gateway and a corresponding OS image for the SBC is staged. The Gateway has no keyboard or display.
  +-PC----------+   +-SBC-----+   +-MCU--------+   +-HDW------+
  | Workstation |<->| Gateway |<->| Controller |<->| Hardware |
  +-WS----------+ ^ +-GW-----=+ ^ +-CTL--------+ ^ +----------+
    UI            |   UI        |                |
                  SSH           MCU defined      Hardware system bus
                                (typically a
                                serial port)

  MCU_ACCESS_METHOD = proxied
  Secure proxied remote access using SSH tunnels. A valid ModDev package is required and a corresponding OS image is staged. The ModDev package is also used to generate scripts for accessing the gateway from the workstation and for accessing the proxy from either the gateway or the workstation.
  +-PC----------+   +-(cloud)+   +-SBC-----+   +-MCU--------+   +-HDW------+
  | Workstation |<->| Proxy  |<->| Gateway |<->| Controller |<->| Hardware |

                  SSH tunnel   SSH tunnel    MCU defined      Hardware system
                                             (typically a     bus
                                             serial port)

Getting started:
All that is needed to get started is a clone of this repository and then run make within the cloned directory. All of the necessary tools are automatically installed within the context of the project directory so that different projects can use different versions of tools without conflicts between versions.

Using an Existing Project:
Before any actual mods can be built it is necessary to declare an active project. This is done by defining the PROJECT variable on the command line along with the URL to clone the project from.

For example:
  make PROJECT=<project> <project>.URL=<url> all
    Will install the project repo and activate it.

Creating a New Local Project:
If creating a new project then the project repo can be created locally and the URL can be set to LOCAL_REPO.

For example:
  make PROJECT=<project> <project>.URL=LOCAL_REPO mk-project
    Will create a new project repo locally and activate it.

Creating and Using a New Remote Project:
If creating a new project repo on a remote server then first create the empty repo on the server. Then create the local project repo and set the URL to the remote server repo.

For example:
  make PROJECT=<project> <project>.URL=<url> mk-project
    Will create a new project repo locally and set the URL to the remote server repo.

Command line options:
  Required sticky options:
  To see the variables needed by projects, kits, and mods use the corresponding help. e.g. make help-projects will display the help related to projects.

  For automated builds it is possible to preset options in another directory then overriding STICKY_PATH either in overrides.mk or on the command line.

See help-projects for more information about projects.

Command line goals:
  all
    All mods for the active project are built. Use show-mod_deps for a list of goals.
  clean
    Remove all of the build artifacts. This removes the build and staging directories.

  Defined by a kit and mod:
  firmware
    Build the mod firmware only.
  parts
    3D printable parts only.
  os
    Build the SBC OS only.
  clean
    Remove the dependency files and the output files.
  reset-sticky
    Resets ALL sticky variables so they have to be defined on the command line again. This does not reset mod specific sticky variables. For mods use the mod defined reset.
  clean-<seg>
    Cleans a make segment output. See segment specific help for more information.
  reset-<seg>-sticky
    Reset segment specific variables. See segment specific help for more information.

  Help and debug:
  show-project_deps
    Display the list of goals a project is dependent upon.
  show-<variable>
    This is a special goal which can be used to display any makefile variable and exit.
  help-<seg>
    Display a make segment specific help.

  See help-helpers for more information.
