define _help
Make segment: ${Seg}.mk

Defines the options shared by all modules.

Unless otherwise noted the configuration variables are sticky variables which can be overridden either on the command line or in overrides.mk. Using overrides eliminates the need to modify the framework itself.

Other make segments can define sticky options. These are options which become defaults once they have been used. Sticky options can also be preset in the sticky directory which helps simplify automated builds especially when build repeatability is required. Each sticky option has its own file in the sticky directory making it possible to have dependencies on the individual sticky files to detect when the options have changed.
STICKY_PATH = ${STICKY_PATH}
  Where sticky options are stored.

_h := modfw_structure
define _help
${_h}
  In a ModFW run only one project can be built at a time. The PROJECT variable indicates which project is being built. This project is the active project.

  The active project is the top level or focus. The project then "uses" one or more mods. Mods can then "use" additional mods and even mods from other
  kits to build components they may be dependent upon. Dependency trees should always begin with the active project.

  The PROJECTS_DIR contains all of the installed projects. Each project is a separate repo. Projects cannot reference or be dependent upon files contained
  in other projects. However, projects can install and use kits which were developed in other projects.

  Projects are intended to be self contained meaning all build artifacts along with the tools needed to build them are contained within the project
  directory structure. This helps avoid version conflicts between projects which use the same but different versions of kits or tools. This also helps
  avoid situations where removing a project breaks the build of another project or results in orphaned build artifacts.

  ModFW is a repo containing the ModFW components needed to build projects or test ModFW. The directory containing the ModFW repo is the root node. All
  other nodes are children of the ModFW root node.

  == ModFW Node Structure ==

  This is the structure of the declared nodes. Typically, the resulting directory structure matches the node structure but it is possible to
  change the location of a particular node. See help-nodes for more information. A typical case for this is to use the variable PROJECTS_DIR
  to change the location where projects are installed and built.

  Legend:
  +-    A root node.
  >-    A child node name.
  --    A directory.
  |     One or more files within a directory.
  ...   Repeats the node sub-structure for each instance.
  <a>   Indicates a node or file name defined by a variable.
  $${X} Indicates a sticky variable which can be overridden on the command line.

  +-ModFW_node (repo) # All other nodes are children of this node.
    --.git
      Files managed by git.
    --.modfw
      Hidden directory where ModFW specific config and temporary files are stored.
    | .gitignore # Ignores STICKY_DIR, DOWNLOADS_DIR and, PROJECTS_DIR.
    | makefile (The top level makefile.)
    >-$${MK_DIR} = ${MK_DIR}
      ModFW makefile segments.
    >-$${TESTS_DIR} = ${TESTS_DIR}
      ModFW makefile segments for testing ModFW.

    The following are not part of the ModFW repo.

    --$${STICKY_DIR} = ${STICKY_DIR}
      Top level sticky variable save files. Ths location of this node is defined by $${STICKY_PATH} which is defined by the helpers (see help-helpers).
      This is redirected to the active project.
    >-$${DOWNLOADS_DIR} = ${DOWNLOADS_DIR} (ignored)
      Where downloaded tools and components are stored. Multiple projects can reference these to avoid redundant downloads.
    >-$${PROJECTS_DIR} = ${PROJECTS_DIR} (ignored)
      Contains all projects. The location of this node is defined by $${PROJECTS_PATH}.
      >-$${PROJECT}... (repo)
        | .gitignore (ignores TOOLS_DIR, KITS_DIR, BUILD_DIR, and STAGING_DIR)
        | <project>.mk
        | Project defined files.
        --.git
          | Files managed by git.
        --$${PROJECT_STICKY_DIR} = ${PROJECT_STICKY_DIR}
          Sticky variables are redirected to this directory when the project is used. Any sticky variables defined by the project or any mods used within a project become part of the project rep.
        >-$${INC_DIR} = ${INC_DIR}
          Where shared include files are stored. This is typically used to provide project specific definitions.
        >-$${TOOLS_DIR} = ${TOOLS_DIR} (ignored)
          Where tools are installed. These can be tools built by mods or downloaded and installed by mods. Mods which use tools provided by other mods must have declared the proper dependencies and the providing mods must have declared the corresponding goals.
          >-$${TOOLS_DIR}.$${BIN_DIR} = ${BIN_DIR}
            Where generic tools and utilities are installed. These are typically installed by mods.
          >-$${TOOLS_DIR}.$${INC_DIR} = ${INC_DIR}
            Where common tool related include files are installed. These are typically installed by mods.
          >-$${TOOLS_DIR}.$${LIB_DIR} = ${LIB_DIR}
            Where shared libraries are stored. These are typically built and installed by mods.
          >-<tool>...
            >-$${<tool>.VERSION}
              When it is not appropriate to install tool related files in a shared location, a mod can define its own set of nodes in which to install a tool. These are the recommended nodes for tool. The actual nodes are defined by the mod. The only requirement is a tool be installed in version specific nodes to help avoid conflicts between different versions of the same tool. For example:
              >-$${<tool>.VERSION}.$${BIN_DIR}
                Where tool executables are installed when a generic location won't work.
              >-$${<tool>.VERSION}.$${LIB_DIR}
                Where tool libraries are installed when a generic location won't work.
              >-$${<tool>.VERSION}.$${INC_DIR}
                Where tool or version specific shared include files are installed.
        >-$${KITS_DIR} = ${KITS_DIR} (ignored)
          A project contains a collection of kits needed to build the project.
          Each kit is a separate repo.
          >-<kit>... (repo) (see help-kits)
            --.git
              | Files managed by git.
            | .gitignore
            | <kit>.mk
            | Kit defined files.
            >-<kit>.$${MODS_DIR} = ${MODS_DIR}
              A kit contains a collection of mods. The mods are part of the containing kit repo.
              | <kit>.mk
              >-<kit>.<mod>... (see help-mods)
                | <mod>.mk
                | .gitignore
                | Mod defined files.
                >-<kit>.<mod>.$${INC_DIR} = ${INC_DIR}
                  | Mod defined include files.
        >-$${BUILD_DIR} = ${BUILD_DIR} (ignored)
          Where tools and mods are built.
          >-<kit>.$${BUILD_DIR}...
            Contains kit build files. Typically these are common to all of the contained mods.
            >-<kit>.<mod>.$${BUILD_DIR}...
              | Mod build files.
        >-$${STAGING_DIR} = ${STAGING_DIR} (ignored)
          >-<kit>.$${STAGING_DIR}...
            Contains staged kit files. Typically these are common to all of the contained mods.
            >-<kit>.<mod>.$${STAGING_DIR}...
              Where a mod stages its files for selection by the project. The project goals copy these files to the project deployment directory. The structure of the nodes within this node are defined by the mod.
        >-$${DEPLOYMENT_DIR} = ${DEPLOYMENT_DIR} (ignored)
          Where selected files from kits and mods are staged for deployment. The structure of the nodes within this node is defined by the project. Files contained in this node become the top level goals for a project. Selected files in the staging nodes are the dependencies for deployable files.
